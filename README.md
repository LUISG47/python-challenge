# CHALLENGUE 3 [Python]


This assignment is meant to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. 

The pybank challengue consists en calculating the increade/decrease profits of a company over a determined period of time.

The pypoll challengue consist on counting the votes of an election and displaying the results of the election.


## Input and output archives

Please make sure to insert the correct route for your input and output .csv files

In each code at the beggining you will see these instructions:

```pon
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "budget_data.csv")  # Input file path
file_to_output = os.path.join("analysis", "budget_analysis.txt")  # Output file path
```


You must insert the correct route in order to be able to read the data and to output the txt file on the desired folder 

In this case the input archive must be stored in a folder called "Resources" and you most point to the correct path in order to read the archive.

The output txt file will be outputted to a folder called "analysis"



# Pybank Challengue Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis will display the following results on the terminal:

The code will also generate a .txt file with the same results on the analysis folder



# Pypoll Challengue Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The code will also generate a .txt file with the same results on the analysis folder
